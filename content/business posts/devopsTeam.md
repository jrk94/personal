A team is a melting pot of different people, with different ideas, working for a common purpose. 

<span class="emojify">:triangular_flag_on_post:</span> Every team needs a banner, a rallying point, a token of membership. That's why I made the CMF Ops banner. For some it's a paper weight, for the others will be a great item that will foment belonging and a sense of being part of something greater.
