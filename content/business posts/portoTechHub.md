# Great Talks

## Chopping the monolith

Thought provoking presentation by [Nicolas Frankel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasfrankel/?originalSubdomain=ch) [GitHub](https://github.com/nfrankel) [Blog Frankel](https://blog.frankel.ch/), `Chopping the monolith`. How to defeat the monolith, how to chop the monolith and most fundamentally, do we really need to defeat the monster in order to get the pricess? Maybe, we can just leave the dragon sleeping and just implement the fast moving and in constant change part of our code as a microservice.

## NestJS Microservices â€“ How to build a project

Interesting back to basics and how to scale talk by [Aleksandar Gavazov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agavazov/?originalSubdomain=bg) [GitHub](https://github.com/agavazov). Opportunity to take a look back and understanding EDD (event driven development) and then scaling to microservices.
