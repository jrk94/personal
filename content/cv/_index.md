# Currently

I work at [Critical Manufacturing](https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/). CMF is an MES company, building the software that makes factories make sense. 

Started out as a *Junior Developer* in September 2018 working in the Project Implementation team. I started working when a new app that was just being created, **Connect IoT**. This was a Node application that was responsible for all aspects related with equipment integration. I had the chance to work on it, improve it and best of all, use it. Built support for some of the drivers ***IPC-CFX, MSSQL, OIB***, etc.

Being one of the few people that worked with this application, got recruited by the <span class="emojify">:clap:</span> ***DevOps*** team <span class="emojify">:clap:</span>. Worked on integrating this on the release pipelines, also on having a test framework to support running integration tests for different equipment protocols. This work is never ending so I am still there, doing this and other cool stuff. You can check out our latest project of building a [CLI](https://github.com/criticalmanufacturing/cli).

Meanwhile, got promoted to *Senior Dev* and later on to *Tech Lead*. Lead teams working on very different projects, from new projects on building support for new features on the product side, to migrating legacy software. Had teams that were full of newbies and teams that were with old cranky developers. I like to think in the end we prevailed. Worked on projects in SMT, Medical Devices, Semi-Conductors and even a sanding company <span class="emojify">:thinking:</span>. </br></br>We worked with MSSQL DB side, angular and typescript front-end side and .net back-end.
